NAME
    WWW::Modbot - Tools for automoderation of Web-based spam.

    WWW::Modbot is used to build and invoke modbots, automatic moderators for a variety of types of Web-based spam.
    This moderation can be synchronous (i.e. the modbot can be invoked during the HTTP call to determine spam status)
    or asynchronous (whereby the HTTP call places the post into a moderation queue or simply posts it, and the modbot
    scans the queue or new posts on a regular basis and removes spammy ones).

    For more information, refer to the documentation for the modbot script, WWW::Modbot, and the many components of
    the modbot system.
