=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<modbot> is a command-line interface to L<WWW::Modbot>, which is used to
do all the work of reading configurations, connecting to servers, applying
tests, calculating scores, and judging whether posts or spam, ham, or indeterminate.

In interactive mode, it provides a complete shell interface for investigating your
configuration and the spam and non-spam currently on the various servers configured.
It can also be invoked in non-interactive mode to perform specific actions as
a scheduled job.

If invoked in non-interactive mode, the first argument must be the identifier of one
of the servers configured, and the remaining arguments will be passed to the command
shell as a single command to be executed against that server.  If 'all' is given
as the server name, then the same command will be executed against each of the servers
configured.

=cut

my $bot = WWW::Modbot->new;
die "Can't find initialization file $bot->{init_file}.\n" unless $bot->{init};
WWW::Modbot::Shell->new($bot)->do(@ARGV);
